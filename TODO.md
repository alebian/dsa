## To implement

* List containing multiple arrays as implementation detail (mix between linked list and array) (to avoid having super big arrays but also don't have the disadvantages of linked lists)

* LRU implementations with variations

* Hash table: Implement with array using linear probing and chaining

    hash(k, m) - m is size of hash table
    add(key, value) - if key already exists, update value
    exists(key)
    get(key)
    remove(key)

* Implement binary search

* Trees: DFS, BFS

- Is symmetric
- Common ancestor

* Trie

* Graphs
